🏨 Hotel Management System (C++)

A complete console-based Hotel Management System written in C++, implementing core Object-Oriented Programming concepts, file handling, sorting, searching, and persistent data storage.

This project simulates real-world hotel operations including customer management, room allocation, checkout handling, and record persistence using text files.

🚀 Features

✔ Add and manage customers

✔ Add and manage rooms

✔ Assign rooms based on availability

✔ Checkout customers and update room status

✔ Persistent storage using text files

✔ Sorting & binary search for fast access

✔ Clean object-oriented design using inheritance and abstraction

🛠 How to Run the Project

1️⃣ Compile the Program

g++ main.cpp -o hotel


2️⃣ Run the Program

./hotel


The system will automatically create rooms.txt and customers.txt if they don't exist.

🧪 Sample Operations

Add new customers with ID, name, age, and phone number

Add hotel rooms with type and price

Assign available rooms to customers

Checkout customers and free up rooms

View all customers and room statuses

🧩 Example Menu
--- HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ---
1. Add Customer
2. Add Room
3. Assign Room
4. Checkout
5. Display All
0. Exit

🧾 Conclusion

The Hotel Management System project successfully demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming principles in C++, combined with effective use of file handling, data structures, and searching & sorting algorithms.
It models real-world hotel operations such as customer management, room allocation, and checkout procedures in a structured and maintainable way.

This project strengthened my understanding of software design, persistent data storage, and system-level problem solving, and serves as a strong foundation for building more advanced management systems in the future.
